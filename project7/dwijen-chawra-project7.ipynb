    "1: I think that this poster did a really good job in comparing the different airlines with the different colors in the heatmaps. I was able to discern all the different times.\n",

    "3: Overall I think that this poster did a good job in showing the different times of the year and the specific highlights about certain points on the main graph were interesting. \n",

    "4: This poster is very organized and tells me a lot about the pathways that the algorithm takes. I was able to understand the different steps that the shortest path algorithm takes.\n",

    "5: Since this is a data expo, I think that the poster should have been more focused on the data and less on the code behind the production of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6: I think that this was a excellent poster, I was able to learn a lot from the visualizations shown on the poster about the flight on time performance, and there was a clear flow in between the different visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7: This poster did a great job of separating the main timeline of the data into smaller sections with the important features individually highlighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "8: This poster has a clear start and end to its analysis, and I was able to learn a lot from the conclusion of the poster."
