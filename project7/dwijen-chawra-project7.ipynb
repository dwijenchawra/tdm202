    "1: I think that this poster did a really good job in comparing the different airlines with the different colors in the heatmaps. I was able to discern all the different times.\n",
    "2: I think that the main visualization on this poster is not quite insightful, it just drew a lot of purple lines on the map. The plots about smaller but more interesting details should have been highlighted more.\n",
    "3: Overall I think that this poster did a good job in showing the different times of the year and the specific highlights about certain points on the main graph were interesting. \n",
    "4: This poster is very organized and tells me a lot about the pathways that the algorithm takes. I was able to understand the different steps that the shortest path algorithm takes.\n",
    "5: Since this is a data expo, I think that the poster should have been more focused on the data and less on the code behind the production of the data.\n",
    "6: I think that this was a excellent poster, I was able to learn a lot from the visualizations shown on the poster about the flight on time performance, and there was a clear flow in between the different visualizations.\n",
